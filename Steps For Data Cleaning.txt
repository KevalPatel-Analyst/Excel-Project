🚀🚀Data Cleaning Project 🚀🚀

GOAL:= The goal of this project was to clean and restructure a messy, cross-tabulated 		       Excel dataset into a well-organized tabular format using Power Query and Excel.        This transformation was essential for enabling effective analysis and reporting,        aligning the data structure with best practices in data analytics.

Steps included in this project 

1. Imported Data into Power Query
•  Loaded the raw data from the Excelfile into Power Query.
• Identified that the first row containedsegment headers instead of actual          column names.

 2. Promoted Headers & Handled Extra Rows
• Used “Use First Row as Headers” to fix column names.
• Removed any unnecessary or empty rows.

3. Separated Consumer Type and Ship Mode
• Observed that Consumer Type and Ship Mode were stored in a cross-tab format.
• Extracted Consumer Type into a separate table.
• Extracted Ship Mode into another table.

4. Unpivoted Data for a Tabular Format
• Unpivoted the Sales Data to make it more structured.
• Ensured that the Consumer Type column was properly formatted.

5. Standardized Values
• Replaced inconsistent values (e.g., Corporate Total → Corporate).
• Corrected any formatting issues in text and numbers.

6. Merged Consumer Type and Ship Mode
• Used Merge Queries to combine the ShipMode data with the Consumer Type table.
• Joined both tables using a common column (e.g., Order ID).
• Expanded the merged columns to include Ship Mode.

7. Final Cleanup & Load Data to Excel
• Verified data structure for correctness.
• Removed any unnecessary columns.
• Loaded the cleaned data back into Excel
